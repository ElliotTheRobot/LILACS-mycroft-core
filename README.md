MyCroft - LILACS Fork 
=====================
See Core issue : https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/issues/629

## LILACS ( Lilacs Is a Learning And Comprehension Subsystem )

a readme with more info is available in each skill folder

### Purpose

Deducing answers and gathering knowledge for offline usage. Lilacs will be called when no intent is matched 

![alt tag](https://github.com/ElliotTheRobot/LILACS-mycroft-core/blob/dev/lilacs-core.jpg)


This fork will be merged / released as add-on when it is complete

The idea is that mycroft gathers knowledge about anything it hears, searches info on several possible backends when asked, and learns from user input

This knowledge comes both in the form of connections/properties of subjects and text info, this allows mycroft:

- to be vocally programmed about relationships of things (music tastes, family relationships)
- to gather all the info from the internet, more backends can be added any time
- to deduce answers from node relationships and answer several kinds of questions
- to be more personal
    - "individual" knowledge between units
    - a "personality" depending on usage history
    - can "talk/rant" about subjects
- store gathered knowledge in several fashions
    - collective database
    - personal database




### Where does the knowledge come from

- WolframAlpha
- ConceptNet
- Wikipedia
- Wikidata
- Dbpedia
- Wikihow
- Wordnik
- Ask user

### Questions LILACS can answer

a question parser is in place so mycroft knows whats being asked

      Question: how to kill animals ( a cow ) and make meat
      question_type: how
      center_node: kill
      target_node: animals
      parents: {u'animals': [u'Species', u'Eukaryote', u'Animal'], u'cow': [u'Species', u'Eukaryote', u'Animal', u'Mammal']}
      relevant_nodes: [u'meat', u'cow']
      synonims: {u'kill': u'murder', u'cow': u'cattle'}

a strategy to answer different kinds of question is in place, answers come from navigating connections and gathering info about concepts

        2017-04-21 18:13:47,752 - CLIClient - INFO - Speak: The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago. Being the oldest domesticated animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior, as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In China and South Vietnam dogs .

Answering what questions

        Input: what is planet
        2017-04-21 18:46:09,672 - CLIClient - INFO - Speak: A planet (from Ancient Greek ἀστήρ πλανήτης astēr planētēs, or πλάνης ἀστήρ plánēs astēr, meaning "wandering star") is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. By careful analysis of the observation data, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology. Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites. More than two thousand planets around other stars ("" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the Milky Way: as of 22 February 2016, 2085 known extrasolar planets in 1331 planetary systems (including 509 multiple planetary systems), ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter. On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20. A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way. Around one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.

        Input:what is life
        2017-04-21 18:50:25,247 - CLIClient - INFO - Speak: Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes (such as signaling and self-sustaining processes) from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (death), or because they lack such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids or potential artificial life as living. Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. Throughout history there have been many theories about life including materialism, hylomorphism and vitalism. Even today it is a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life. The smallest contiguous unit of life is called an organism. Organisms are composed of one or more cells, undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, can grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce (either sexually or asexually) and, through evolution, adapt to their environment in successive generations. A diverse array of living organisms can be found in the biosphere of Earth, and the properties common to these organisms are a carbon- and water-based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era when sufficient crust had solidified following the molten Hadean Eon. The earliest physical evidence of life on Earth is biogenic graphite from 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks found in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone found in Western Australia. Some theories, such as the Late Heavy Bombardment theory, suggest that life on Earth may have started even earlier, as early as 4.1-4.4 billion years ago. According to one of the researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe." The mechanism by which life began on Earth is unknown, although many hypotheses have been formulated. Since emerging, life has evolved into a variety of forms, which have been classified into a hierarchy of taxa. Life can survive and thrive in a wide range of conditions. Nonetheless, it is estimated that 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described. The chemistry leading to life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old. Though life is confirmed only on the Earth, many think that extraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable or inevitable. Other planets and moons in the Solar System and other planetary systems are being examined for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as SETI are trying to detect radio transmissions from possible alien civilizations.

As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass and (without tidal effects) the Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Therefore, the planet is expected to escape envelopment by the expanded Sun's sparse outer atmosphere, though most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed because of the Sun's increased luminosity. However, a more recent simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the red giant Sun's atmosphere and be destroyed.)

Use a large microwave safe glass or plastic bowl to microwave your eggs. Place your eggs in a single layer in the bottom of the bowl. Do not stack the eggs on top of each other and be careful not to crack the eggs.[1];", "Add water to the bowl. Pour enough water over your eggs so that they are completely covered with water. There should also be about a centimeter (or half an inch) of water above the eggs. If the eggs are not completely covered with water, then they may explode.[2]To speed up the cooking process, you can pour boiling water over the eggs instead of room temperature water. You will still need to cover the eggs completely with water.[3]", "Pour one tablespoon of salt into the bowl. Measure out a tablespoon of salt and then sprinkle it into the water. The salt will help to prevent the eggs from exploding while they are in the microwave.", "Cook the eggs for up to 12 minutes. Set your microwave on medium power and begin microwaving the eggs. The eggs may take anywhere from six to 12 minutes to become hard boiled, depending on your microwave. The eggs may be ready sooner if your microwave is high-powered or if you prefer your eggs softer.[4][5]If you poured boiling water over your eggs, then you can just cook them for three to six minutes on high.[6]You can check to see if your eggs are done by taking an egg out of the water, putting it in ice cold water for a few minutes, and then cracking it. However, if you do not want to check, then just cook your eggs for a little longer than you think they will need.", "Let the eggs cool down before you touch them. When the eggs are done, the bowl and water will be very hot, so wear an oven mitt when you take the eggs out of the microwave. Do not reach into the bowl or touch any of the eggs until they have cooled down.[7]You can also drain the hot water and refill the bowl with cold water to speed up the cooling process. This will also prevent the eggs from becoming overcooked.[8]", "Enjoy your hard-boiled eggs. After your eggs have cooled down completely, you can crack them open and enjoy them. Eat them or use them in a recipe. For example, you can use your hard-boiled eggs to make deviled eggs, egg salad, or Easter eggs.", "Use this method for safe, even cooking. Breaking the egg apart also breaks the first step in hard-boiling, but if you're using a microwave, this is highly recommended. Cooking the egg yolk and white separately ensures that each part is cooked just as \"hard\" as you want it, and removes the risk of a scalding explosion.This method of microwaving eggs is sometimes called \"hard-cooking,\" since it doesn't involve any water, but results in an egg with a hard-boiled texture.", "Lightly grease two bowls. Rub the inside of two small, microwave-safe bowls with butter or butter substitute, using a paper towel. Custard ramekins work well if you are only cooking one egg, but you can use any size container.", "Separate the egg whites and egg yolks. Crack the egg open carefully, then separate the two halves of shell, with the egg still inside one of them. Pour the egg yolk from one half of the shell to the other repeatedly, until all of the egg white has separated from the yolk. Put the yolk into one bowl, and the egg white into the other. If you are cooking more than one egg, repeat this step, keeping all yolks in one bowl and all whites in another.If this is too tedious, you can just drop the entire egg into one bowl. This can lead to a runny white or an overcooked, rubbery yolk, since the two parts cook at different rates in the microwave.[9]", "Pierce the egg yolks. Even the thin membrane holding the yolk together will build up pressure as the moisture inside heats up, eventually exploding messily. Prevent this by piercing each yolk with the tip of a knife, skewer, or fork to let the steam escape.[10]", "Cover each bowl. Contrary to rumor, plastic wrap can be safely used for this purpose, as long as it does not touch the food itself.[11] Parchment paper or wax paper can be used instead.", "Cook the white at medium or low power. If your microwave oven has a medium or low power setting, use it whenever cooking eggs or egg dishes, since eggs are easily overcooked to a rubbery, superheated mess. Because it's difficult to control the temperature of microwaved food, it's best to cook in short bursts, checking frequently. Follow these guidelines for typical, large chicken eggs:Most importantly, take the egg white out while it is still slightly underdone, before it is completely hard. The egg will continue to cook from its own heat after removal.Cook 1 egg white (or 1 whole egg) for about 30 to 60 seconds.[12]Cook 2 egg whites for about 45 to 75 seconds.[13]Cook 4 egg whites for about 2 minutes 30 seconds to 3 minutes 15 seconds.[14]", "Cook the yolk for 20 to 30 seconds per yolk. Remove the bowl containing white and put in the yolk. Still on medium or low power if the option is available, cook the bowl of egg yolk for about 20 to 30 seconds per yolk.[15] If cooking more than one yolk, stop every 30 seconds to check on progress. Remove the yolk once it's slightly softer than you prefer.", "Let the egg stand for two or three minutes. Microwaves heat up the fat in the egg much hotter than a pot of boiling water does. This heat will continue to cook the egg after it is removed. If part of the egg isn't hard enough after three minutes, cook it for another 10 to 20 seconds.There is no way to make an overcooked egg softer, so it's usually better to aim for a slightly soft \"hard-cooked\" egg."], "url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave", "title": "Hardboil Eggs in a Microwave", "steps": ["Place your eggs in a microwave safe bowl.", "Add water to the bowl.", "Pour one tablespoon of salt into the bowl.", "Cook the eggs for up to 12 minutes.", "Let the eggs cool down before you touch them.", "Enjoy your hard-boiled eggs.", "Use this method for safe, even cooking.", "Lightly grease two bowls.", "Separate the egg whites and egg yolks.", "Pierce the egg yolks.", "Cover each bowl.", "Cook the white at medium or low power.", "Cook the yolk for 20 to 30 seconds per yolk.", "Let the egg stand for two or three minutes."], "pics": ["http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-1-Version-3.jpg", "http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/a/a5/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-2-Version-3.jpg", "http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/53/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-3-Version-3.jpg", "http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/9/9b/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-4-Version-3.jpg", "http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/10/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-5-Version-3.jpg", "http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/8/80/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-6-Version-3.jpg", "http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/4f/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-1-Version-2.jpg", "http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/8/84/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-2-Version-2.jpg", "http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-3-Version-2.jpg", "http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/b4/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-4-Version-2.jpg", "http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/15/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-5-Version-2.jpg", "http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-6-Version-2.jpg", "http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/7/73/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-7.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-7.jpg", "http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/12/Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-8.jpg/aid238320-v4-728px-Hardboil-Eggs-in-a-Microwave-Step-8.jpg"]}, "Make Scrambled Eggs": {"detailed": ["Prepare the eggs.

Gently place your eggs at the bottom of a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stack them very gently to avoid breaking. Don't stack them more than four-deep.[1]If you're unsure whether your eggs are fresh, test them by placing them in a bowl of salt water. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh. If it floats to the top, get rid of it.To keep the eggs from cracking as they boil, you can try placing a folded cheesecloth at the bottom of the pot to pad them. However, this isn't required.;", "Fill the pan with cold tap water. Cover the eggs gently with at least one inch (3 cm) of water. Add a pinch of salt. You can steady the eggs with your hand as you add the water to keep the eggs from breaking. Alternatively, just point the stream of water at the side of the pan.Cold water helps to keep the eggs from overcooking. Never drop eggs directly into a pot of hot water, or the shells will crack and the egg will run (giving you poached eggs).[2]Salted water helps to make the egg white firm up more quickly. It also helps plug small leaks if the shell cracks during the cooking process.[3]", "Place the pan on medium heat. Cover the pan with a lid. Let the water come to a gentle boil. The water will boil a bit more quickly with the lid on, but it's fine to leave it off if you'd rather keep an eye on the eggs.You can stir the eggs very gently every now and then to make sure they've not settled at the bottom, where they'll cook less evenly and break more easily. Use a wooden spoon to stir and be very gentle.", "Remove from heat when the water boils. As soon as the water reaches a full boil, turn the heat off. Leave the lid on the pan. The heat of the water and the remaining warmth from the burner will be enough to finish cooking your eggs. Depending on how hard or soft you like your eggs, you can leave them like this for about 3-20 minutes:If you like your eggs soft-boiled, remove them from the water in three minutes or less. The whites should be set, while the yolks should be runny and warm.[4]If you like your eggs medium-boiled, remove them from the water in 5-7 minutes. The yolks should be semi-soft in the very center and the whites should be very firm.If you like your eggs hard-boiled, leave the eggs in the hot water for up to 10-15 minutes. The yolks should be firm all the way through. It's difficult to overcook eggs this way.", "Chill the eggs to stop the cooking process. As soon as you've waited for your eggs to finish cooking, drain the hot water from the pan gently. You can also remove the eggs one by one with a slotted spoon. Place the eggs under cold running water or drop them carefully into a bowl of ice water to bring their temperature down quickly. Let them sit in cool water for about five minutes.Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand comfortably, put them in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to loosen the shells.If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are, you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them right after chilling them.To test whether an egg is hard-boiled without breaking it, whirl it on a table. If it spins fast and easy, it is hard boiled. If it wobbles, it needs more time.", "Peel the eggs when you're ready to eat them. Press each egg into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell. Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell. This makes it slightly easier to peel. Rinse the eggs under cold water as you peel them to keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg.Quick peeling tip: Put the eggs back in the pan you cooked them in and put the lid back on. Shake the pan back and forth to crack all the shells at once.", "Store eggs in the refrigerator for 5 days. After peeling the eggs, they're ready to eat. You can store leftovers in a bowl with a plate on top or a sealed container. In both cases, cover the eggs with a wet paper towel. Change the paper towel each day to keep the eggs from drying out.[5] Eat the eggs within four to five days.You can also store the eggs in cold water. Change the water each day to keep the eggs from breaking down.Hard-boiled eggs can be stored several days before cracking and peeling them, but they tend to get a little rubbery and dried out. It's usually better to keep peeled eggs moist in the fridge with water or a paper towel.", "Heat water to boiling in a microwave-safe bowl. The microwave generally doesn't work quite as well as the stove for hard-boiled eggs, but with a little patience it can work in a pinch. Here, you'll want to boil the water in the microwave without the eggs first. See our guide to boiling water in the microwave safely for important information.This bears repeating: don't heat unbeaten eggs in the microwave. Even out of the shell, a build-up of pressure in the yolk can cause them to explode, damaging your microwave.[6]", "Remove the bowl and carefully add the eggs. Using a towel or oven mitt, take the bowl out of the microwave. Use a slotted spoon to add the eggs one by one. Make sure each is covered completely by the water.Don't drop the eggs directly into the water.

Let it sit \u2014 the eggs will cook in the heat of the near-boiling water. Your cooking time will vary depending on how hard you want your eggs. In general, you should expect your eggs to take slightly more time than they would on the stove. This is because they did not have a chance to cook while the water was heating up.If you like your eggs soft-boiled, let them sit for 10 minutes or less.[7] The yolk should still be somewhat runny.If you like your eggs medium-boiled, let them sit for about 15 minutes.[8] The yolk should be semi-soft and the whites should be quite firm.If you like your eggs hard-boiled, let them sit for 20 minutes or more.[9] The white and yolk should be completely firm without being an unappealing grey-green color.", "Remove the eggs and chill as normal. After you've let your eggs sit, remove them from the water with a strainer or a slotted spoon. At this point, the rest of the process is the same as for eggs you've cooked on the stove. See below:Cover the eggs with cold water or set them in an ice bath for about five minutes so that they cool.When the eggs can be comfortably held, you can crack and peel them right away or stick them in the fridge for 20-30 minutes to make this easier.Store the eggs under a moist paper towel or submerged in water in the fridge. Eat the eggs within four or five days, changing the towel or water every day.", "If your yolks are grayish-green, cook for less time. Letting boiled eggs cook for too long will give the yolks a gray-green ring and a sulfur-like smell. There's nothing wrong with these eggs and they are perfectly safe for eating. However, if you find this unappetizing, simply reduce the amount of time you let your eggs cook for next time.The gray-green color is formed when iron from the yolk reacts with hydrogen sulfide from the white.[10] This reaction occurs after the rest of the egg has finished cooking.Extra heat also tends to over-coagulate the proteins in the egg. This can give rubbery whites and dry yolks.", "If your egg is too runny, cook for more time. If you don't use enough heat when cooking your eggs, you may find yourself with the opposite problem as the gray-green yolks above. Eggs that don't cook long enough may have yolks that aren't as firm as you'd like. Extremely undercooked eggs may even have whites that aren't completely set. If you notice that the first egg you peel and crack is undercooked, return the rest to hot water and allow to sit.Undercooked eggs can pose a risk of salmonella infection. The FDA recommends cooking all eggs until the yolks are firm or using eggs that have been in-shell pasteurized.[11]As noted above, you can spin an egg on a hard surface to test whether it is hard boiled. If it spins evenly (like a top), the egg is finished. Undercooked or uncooked eggs will wobble or spiral off to one side.", "Steam fresh eggs to make them easier to peel. When eggs are just a day or two old, the membrane sticks to the shell, making the egg difficult to peel.[12] The best eggs for hard-boiling are about 7-10 days old. If you have to boil very fresh eggs, try steaming them first to help separate the membrane from the shell:Place the eggs in a metal colander and rest the colander on top of a pan. Boil an inch or so of water in the pan for about 10 minutes, turning the eggs frequently. After, boil the eggs as normal.[13]Some people also like to add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water when boiling eggs that are very fresh. This can add a sulfuric taste to the eggs, however.", "Crack and soak eggs that are difficult to peel. If you notice the white of the egg sticking to the shell as you peel it, roll the egg around to make lots of little cracks in the surface of the shell. Then, place the egg in a bowl of cold water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. This often helps to loosen the shell up and separate the membrane, making it much easier to peel.", "Add vinegar if an egg cracks in the water. This is a common problem, especially with eggs that are very cold. If you notice that an egg has cracked, a teaspoon of vinegar in the water helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster, plugging the cracks in the shell.[14] Try to be quick here \u2014 if you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly.You may notice a little whiteness creeping out of a cracked egg.

{"detailed": ["Bring your eggs to room temperature before cooking. If you keep your eggs in the refrigerator, it's important that you don't try to cook them cold. Eggs crack because gases heat and expand within the shell. When the pressure becomes too great, the gases escape by cracking weak points in the porous shell. Bringing eggs to room temperature before cooking slows down that process.If you don't want to wait for the eggs to warm up naturally, try soaking them in hot tap water for a few minutes before cooking.;", "Use older eggs, if possible. When an egg is fresh, the the outer membrane sticks to the egg shell while the inner membrane sticks to the albumen (the \"white\"). As an egg ages, these membranes adhere more closely to the shell itself.[1]", "Release trapped gas to less the likelihood of cracking. Before you submerge an egg, prick the large end of the shell with a clean thumbtack or safety pin. This will allow the trapped air bubbles\u2014which are normally responsible for cracking\u2014to escape during the boiling process.[2]", "Sort the eggs and place them in a pot or saucepan. Stack the eggs very gently to avoid cracking. Don't overcrowd the pot\u2014you should only boil one layer of eggs at a time, and they should not be pressing against each other. If you try to boil too many eggs at once, some of them may crack from the weight.[3]Test whether your eggs are fresh by placing them into a bowl of saltwater. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh. If it floats to the top, there's a good chance that it has gone bad.Lay a folded cheesecloth inside the bottom of the pot. This helps cushion the eggs so that they are less likely to crack.", "Cover the eggs with cold tap water. Fill the pot gently with at least one inch (3 cm) of water. Pour the water against the side of the pan so that it does not disturb the eggs. If you cannot avoid pouring the water onto the eggs, steady them with your hand so that they do not slide around and crack.Add half a teaspoon of salt to the water. This makes the eggs easier to peel, and it may help prevent them from cracking. Salted water helps to make the egg white firm up more quickly. It also helps plug small leaks if the shell cracks during the cooking process.Never drop eggs directly into a pot of hot water, or the shells will crack and the egg will run (giving you poached eggs). By exposing cold eggs to warm or hot water, you are \"shocking\" them with a sudden temperature shift, which causes cracks to form.[4] Furthermore, cold water helps to keep the eggs from overcooking.", "Add vinegar to the water. Use one teaspoon of vinegar for each egg, and pour it directly into the water before you turn the heat on. Adding vinegar to the water helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster to plug any cracks that develop in the shell.[5] This is a common problem, especially with eggs that are very cold.You can also wait to add vinegar when an egg cracks in the water. You may notice a bit of white fluid seeping from a cracked egg. Try to be quick here \u2014 if you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly.If you don't add the vinegar in time, don't worry. The cracked egg should still boil fine, although it may not look perfect.[6]Be sparing. If you use too much, your eggs will taste and smell like vinegar.", "Bring the water to a gentle boil using a medium heat. Let the water boil slowly so that the eggs do not crack from a rapid temperature shift. Cover the pot with a lid. The water will boil a bit more quickly with the lid on, but feel free to leave it off if you want to keep an eye on the eggs.[7]Make sure that the eggs don't settle at the bottom, where they'll cook less evenly and break more easily. Stir the water any time that you see the eggs begin to settle. Use a wooden spoon to stir, and be very gentle so that you don't crack the eggs.", "Turn off the heat when the water boils. As soon as the water reaches a full boil, turn the heat off and let the eggs sit in the hot water. Leave the lid on the pan. The heat of the water and the remaining warmth from the burner will be enough to finish cooking your eggs. Leave the eggs in the pot for another 3-15 minutes, depending how hard or soft you like them:If you like your eggs soft-boiled, remove them from the water within three minutes. The whites should be set, while the yolks should be runny and warm. Be very gentle when you remove the eggs\u2014scoop each egg out with a large spoon to avoid cracking.[8]If you like your eggs medium-boiled, take them out of the water in 5-7 minutes. The yolks should be semi-soft in the center, and the whites should be very firm. You should still handle the eggs gently, but you don't need to worry as much about them cracking.If you like your eggs hard-boiled, leave them in the hot water for 9-12 minutes. The yolks should be firm all the way through, and you don't need to worry about the eggs cracking. If you want a solid but soft and bright yellow yolk, leave the eggs in water for 9-10 minutes. If you'd like eggs with a harder, pale yellow center, leave them in for 11-12 minutes.", "Keep a close eye on the clock, and do not let your eggs overcook. After 12 minutes, your yolk will develop grayish or greenish streaks. The egg is still edible, and the streaks don't have much effect on taste. However, some people find green- and gray-streaked eggs less appetizing.[9] Consider buying a color-changing egg timer, a heat-sensitive indicator that you can place in the water with your boiling eggs. You can find these timers online or at kitschy kitchen-supply stores.[10]", "Know when it is safe to eat a cracked egg. If the egg cracks in the water while cooking, it should still be safe to eat \u2014 and, indeed, it may still cook normally if the crack is not too severe. If an egg is cracked before you start cooking, do not bother to boil it. Bacteria may well have penetrated the shell and infected the interior, making it potentially hazardous to your health.[11]", "Prepare a bowl of ice-water. While the eggs are cooking in the hot water, fill a large bowl with cold water. Dissolve another 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt in the water, then add ice to lower the temperature further. When the eggs are done cooking, you will carefully move them into this bowl to stop them from cooking any more.", "Chill the eggs to stop the cooking process. After your eggs have cooked for the desired amount of time, gently drain the hot water from the pan, then move the eggs to the bowl of ice-water to stop the cooking process. Remove the eggs one by one with a slotted spoon to avoid cracking. Carefully drop the eggs into the bowl of ice water to bring their temperature down. Let them cool for 2-5 minutes.", "Refrigerate the eggs or serve them immediately. Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand, put them in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to loosen the shells. If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are\u2014or if you like your eggs warm\u2014you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them immediately after chilling them.", "Make sure that your eggs are thoroughly hard-boiled. Spin an egg on a table to test whether it is hard-boiled without breaking it open. If the egg twirls quickly and easily, it is hard-boiled. If it wobbles, let it cook for longer.", "Peel the eggs when you're ready to eat them. Press each egg into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell. Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell. This makes it slightly easier to peel.Rinse the eggs under cold water as you peel them. This helps keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg.It is usually easier to peel eggs once they are cracked. Put the eggs back in the pot with the lid on. Shake the pot back and forth to crack the shells before you begin peeling. You may need to do this several times to crack them all.", "Use a teaspoon to keep the egg white intact while you peel it. Pinch off a small section of shell and membrane from the large end. Slip the spoon inside the shell and membrane so that it cups the egg. Then, simply slide the spoon around to peel off sections of shell.", "Store eggs in the refrigerator for up to five days. The eggs are ready to eat as soon as you peel them. Store the leftover eggs in a sealed container, and cover them with a wet paper towel. Change the paper towel each day to keep the eggs from drying out. Eat the eggs within four to five days, before they go bad.You can also store the eggs in cold water. Change the water each day to keep the eggs from breaking down.You can store hard-boiled eggs for several days before you crack and peel them.

Are you someone who prefers a soft-boiled egg or a hard-boiled egg? Occasionally, you might even have to make different levels of boiled egg just to please every member of the household! The times suggested throughout this article are dependent on personal preference, so some experimenting should take place. The types of boiled egg are:Coddled, or soft-boiled \u2013 very gooey yolk.Mollet eggs \u2013 these will have a semi-liquid yolk; outer white is firm enough for shell to be peeled.Hard-boiled \u2013 yolk is cooked to firmness.", "Choose your method. As you will see from the following various suggested methods, making boiled eggs is something of an art form that has arisen through trial and error for many centuries. If you don't already have a preferred method, perhaps try out each method to achieve the desired result before choosing one that you intend to rely on.For soft boiled eggs, the rule of thumb is to use the shorter cooking times for softly set whites and runny yolks. Increase the cooking time for firmly set whites and slightly set yolks.[1]For hard-boiled eggs, bear in mind that cooking the eggs any longer than 12 minutes should not be done because this risks turning the whites rubbery and the yolks crumbly.[2]If you want the egg yolk to remain centered (often important for appearance when using a hard-boiled egg for a special dish), cook the eggs in cold water from the start and slowly bring to the boil. Stir gently using a wooden spoon as this happens, until they're boiling, and you'll find that the yolks stay centered.[3][4]Note that when a method suggests boiling once the eggs are in the water, that this means simmering. Rapid boiling will cause the eggs to turn rubbery and tough. [5] High cooking temperatures toughen the protein in eggs, and since eggs coagulate with heat, the best cooking methods will always involve cooking slowly at a low temperature.[6]", "Prepare the egg. Eggs that have been refrigerated for several days have a higher pH and are more likely to crack, but they are easier to peel. Cooking expert Rose Elliot recommends pricking the egg at its rounded end prior to boiling.[7] She suggests that doing this helps the air to escape and prevents the egg from bursting or cracking.[8][9] Special egg-prickers can be purchased, or you can use a needle. Alternatively, if you've never found this to be an issue with the eggs you use because you've kept them at room temperature or they're fresh from the hens, then you probably don't need to worry about it.In each case, you can boil more than one egg at a time; just be sure there is sufficient room. It is possible to purchase special egg holders for more than one egg boiling \u2013 speak to a kitchen retailer for more details.If the eggs do crack, a few drops of vinegar will stop leakage from the shell.[10]A cracked egg can also be wrapped in aluminum foil and boiled.[11]", "Remove hot eggs with care. Use a slotted spoon to remove eggs from boiling water and take the usual precautions around hot water.", "Choose room temperature eggs.[12]", "Lay the eggs gently in an empty pot.", "Cover the eggs with about 1\" or 2.5cm of water. Use room temperature water. If the water is cold, the eggs will take longer to cook. If the water is hot, though, you may risk the water getting too hot too early and overcooking the eggs (that is, exposing the eggs to boiling temperature for too long).", "Add one tablespoon of salt or vinegar to the water. This helps the proteins in the white coagulate faster so any cracks in the shell quickly get plugged.[13]", "Cover the pot.", "Bring the water to a boil. Stay close and listen; you should be able to hear the water come to a boil. Do not remove the lid to check. Remove the pot from heat as soon as the water is boiling. The eggs will not overcook. Keep the lid on so the water remains at slightly below boiling point. At this stage, decide about how long you want to leave the eggs in for:Let the eggs sit for 3 to 5 minutes for coddled or \"soft-boiled\" eggs - runny yolk.Let the eggs sit for 5-6 minutes for Mollet eggs - slightly runny yolk.Remove the eggs as soon as the water boils. This is one method suggested by the Larousse Gastronomique for the cold water to boiling method.[14]", "Bring the water to the boil in the pot.", "Select room temperature eggs.[15]", "Add the eggs to the boiling water. Decide how long to plunge the eggs for:Plunge the eggs into the boiling water and boil for three minutes.[16] Remove after the time is up.Plunge the eggs into boiling water and boil for one minute only. Remove the pot from the heat and leave the eggs to stand for 3 minutes before removing them from the hot water with a slotted spoon.[17]", "Choose the eggs. The best eggs for hard-boiling are eggs that are several days old. [18] A fresh egg will be much harder to peel as the white still sticks to the shell. If you are planning on peeling the hard-boiled egg for other uses, keep this in mind if boiling eggs freshly collected from your hens.", "Place the eggs into the empty pot. Add salt or vinegar to the water if you accidentally crack an egg. It may help the proteins in the egg white thicken faster to plug the cracks in the shell.[19]", "Fill the pot with enough cold tap water to cover the eggs. Leave about 1 inch (3 cm) of water over them. Use cold water to help keep the eggs from overcooking, although doing this increases the cooking time.", "Add just enough salt to make the water taste salty. This can make the eggs easier to peel because, as mentioned earlier, the proteins coagulate and firm up, making the white easier to separate from the shell. Also, eggs that are less fresh are easier to peel because their higher pH strengthens the membrane. (This can be simulated by making the cooking water more alkaline with a half teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water.)[20]", "Put on the lid. Bring the water to the point of boiling, over high heat. From here, there are different approaches to the boiling times and methods:This following method assumes you started with cold, refrigerated eggs. As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat, but keep the pot on the warm stove. Do not remove the lid. Leave the eggs in the hot water for ten to fifteen minutes.[21] It is important you do not start the timer until the water starts boiling, and that you turn off the heat. Too much time will make the eggs discolored and smelly, while too little time will cause them to be runny.The Larousse Gastronomique recommends that eggs (room temperature) should be cooked for 10-12 minutes and then plunged into cold water for 7-8 minutes. This will allow them to cool prior to shelling.[22]", "Stop the cooking process. Chill the eggs by placing them under cold running water or in a bowl of ice water. Let them sit for a few minutes until the eggs are cool.", "Fill a small saucepan three quarters of the way with water. Bring the water to the boil.", "Place the egg(s) into the boiling water. Start timing from this point.", "Keep the water at a steady simmer. The hard boiled stage is reached at:8 minutes for a lightly hard boiled egg10 minutes for a dark yellow moist dry yolk and a set white15 minutes for a light yellow, dry, and granular yolk.", "Plunge the boiled egg into cold water once sufficient cooking time is over. Doing this stops any further cooking and stops the development of a gray line between the yolk and the egg white.[24] Peeling is easier under cold water, or cold running water (see next).", "Peel the eggs when they are cool enough to handle. There are two possible ways:Peel them under cold running water. This method works if you don't want to plunge them in cold water.Try to crack the shells when they're cooling in water. This makes them easier to peel cleanly. When the eggs are done cooking, pour off the hot water and replace with cold. Pick up each egg (be careful, they'll still be hot), and drop it back into the pot of cold water so the shell cracks. As they cool, water pulls into the shells. It will be easier for the shell removal without the egg itself. This is especially useful for dishes where appearance is important, such as with deviled eggs.", "Roll the egg. If you're not using water, another method for peeling the egg is to roll it on a hard surface.[25] This will crack the shell and loosen the membrane. Only do this with eggs cool enough to handle, or use silicon mitts.", "Slice hard-boiled eggs. If you intend on slicing boiled eggs, do as follows:[26]Rinse a knife in hot water.Wipe the knife dry every few cuts to remove sticking yolk from the knife.Repeat as much as needed.If you need to chop hard boiled eggs for a salad, mash them using a potato masher.[27]", "Eat and enjoy!"], "url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Boil-Eggs", "title": "Boil Eggs", "steps": ["Choose your preferred style of

==========

NOTE: The default branch for this repo is dev. This should be considered a working beta. If you want to clone a more stable version, switch over to the 'master' branch.  

Full docs at: https://docs.mycroft.ai

Release notes at: https://docs.mycroft.ai/release-notes

Pair Mycroft instance at: https://home.mycroft.ai

Join the Mycroft Slack(chat) channel: http://mycroft-ai-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/

Looking to join in developing?  Check out the [Project Wiki](../../wiki/Home) for tasks you can tackle!

# Getting Started

### Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, or Fedora
- Run the build host setup script for your OS (Ubuntu/Debian: `build_host_setup_debian.sh`, Arch: `build_host_setup_arch.sh`, Fedora: `build_host_setup_fedora.sh`). This installs necessary packages, please read it
- Run `dev_setup.sh` (feel free to read it, as well)
- Restart session (reboot computer, or logging out and back in might work).

### Other environments

The following packages are required for setting up the development environment,
 and are what is installed by `build_host_setup` scripts.

 - `git`
 - `python 2`
 - `python-setuptools`
 - `python-virtualenv`
 - `pygobject`
 - `virtualenvwrapper`
 - `libtool`
 - `libffi`
 - `openssl`
 - `autoconf`
 - `bison`
 - `swig`
 - `glib2.0`
 - `s3cmd`
 - `portaudio19`
 - `mpg123`
 - `flac`
 - `curl`

## Home Device and Account Manager
Mycroft AI, Inc. - the company behind Mycroft maintains the Home device and account management system. Developers can sign up at https://home.mycroft.ai

By default the Mycroft software is configured to use Home, upon any request such as "Hey Mycroft, what is the weather?", you will be informed that you need to pair and Mycroft will speak a 6-digit code, which you enter into the pairing page on the [Home site](https://home.mycroft.ai).

Once signed and a device is paired, the unit will use our API keys for services, such as the STT (Speech-to-Text) API. It also allows you to use our API keys for weather, Wolfram-Alpha, and various other skills.

Pairing information generated by registering with Home is stored in:

`~/.mycroft/identity/identity2.json` <b><-- DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS!</b>

It's useful to know the location of the identity file when troubleshooting device pairing issues.

## Using Mycroft without Home.
If you do not wish to use our service, you may insert your own API keys into the configuration files listed below in <b>configuration</b>.

The place to insert the API key looks like the following:

`[WeatherSkill]`

`api_key = ""`

Put the relevant key in between the quotes and Mycroft Core should begin to use the key immediately.

### API Key services

- [STT API, Google STT](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys)
- [Weather Skill API, OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Wolfram-Alpha Skill](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/)

These are the keys currently in use in Mycroft Core.

## Configuration
Mycroft configuration consists of 3 possible config files.
- `mycroft-core/mycroft/configuration/mycroft.conf`
- `/etc/mycroft/mycroft.conf`
- `$HOME/.mycroft/mycroft.conf`

When the configuration loader starts, it looks in those locations in that order, and loads ALL configuration. Keys that exist in multiple config files will be overridden by the last file to contain that config value. This results in a minimal amount of config being written for a specific device/user, without modifying the distribution files.

# Running Mycroft Quick Start
To start the essential tasks run `./mycroft.sh start`. Which will start the service, skills, voice and cli (using --quiet mode) in a detched screen and log the output of the screens to the their respective log files (e.g. ./log/mycroft-service.log).
Optionally you can run `./mycroft.sh start -v` Which will start the service, skills and voice. Or `./mycroft.sh start -c` Which will start the service, skills and cli.

To stop Mycroft run `./mycroft.sh stop`. This will quit all of the detached screens.
To restart Mycroft run './mycroft.sh restart`.

Quick screen tips
- run `screen -list` to see all running screens
- run `screen -r [screen-name]` (e.g. `screen -r mycroft-service`) to reatach a screen
- to detach a running screen press `ctrl + a, ctrl + d`
See the screen man page for more details 

# Running Mycroft
## With `start.sh`
Mycroft provides `start.sh` to run a large number of common tasks. This script uses the virtualenv created by `dev_setup.sh`. The usage statement lists all run targets, but to run a Mycroft stack out of a git checkout, the following processes should be started:

- run `./start.sh service`
- run `./start.sh skills`
- run `./start.sh voice`

*Note: The above scripts are blocking, so each will need to be run in a separate terminal session.*

## Without `start.sh`

Activate your virtualenv.

With virtualenv-wrapper:
```
workon mycroft
```

Without virtualenv-wrapper:
```
source ~/.virtualenvs/mycroft/bin/activate
```


- run `PYTHONPATH=. python client/speech/main.py` # the main speech detection loop, which prints events to stdout and broadcasts them to a message bus
- run `PYTHONPATH=. python client/messagebus/service/main.py` # the main message bus, implemented via web sockets
- run `PYTHONPATH=. python client/skills/main.py` # main skills executable, loads all skills under skills dir

*Note: The above scripts are blocking, so each will need to be run in a separate terminal session. Each terminal session will require that the virtualenv be activated. There are very few reasons to use this method.*

# FAQ/Common Errors

#### When running mycroft, I get the error `mycroft.messagebus.client.ws - ERROR - Exception("Uncaught 'error' event.",)`

This means that you are not running the `./start.sh service` process. In order to fully run Mycroft, you must run `./start.sh service`, `./start.sh skills`, and `./start.sh voice`/`./start.sh cli` all at the same time. This can be done using different terminal windows, or by using the included `./mycroft.sh start`, which runs all four process using `screen`.
